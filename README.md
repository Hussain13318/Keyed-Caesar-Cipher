# Keyed-Caesar-Cipher
This project implements a Keyed Caesar Cipher in C/C++/Assembly (depending on your version), which is a stronger variant of the traditional Caesar cipher. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt text or files using a secret keyword and a shift value.

The program generates a custom alphabet from the keyword, applies the Caesar shift, and supports:

Text encryption/decryption

File encryption/decryption

Input validation for letters and shift values

History logging of all operations

It features ASCII art menus, interactive prompts, and safe error handling for invalid inputs or files.

Key Concepts: Custom alphabets, XOR/Shift encryption, file handling, input validation, history logging, and user-friendly console interface.
